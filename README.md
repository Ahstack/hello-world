# hello-world
This is my hello world repository.
I am most recently experienced in Python, but I have a history with C++ as well.
I also played around with HTML in another time.

I have worked in multiple industries, and I have worked on development in the past.
I decided that it is time to increase my emphasis on these skills, and I'm very happy to be here.
